# Meena Ambalam's Portfolio
Meena's Portfolio Wesite

## Description

```
This site is my portfolio website,
through which I will be able to showcase my coding projects and sites, for visibility to future employers.
This portfolio site has been attempted to be responsive such that the content and images are responsive to all size media screens.

```

## Functioning of the site
```
The landing page is the "About" page (aka Home Page).
The "About" link in the Navbar and link behind my name "Meena Ambalam" will also take user to the home page. 
The "Portfolio" link in the Navbar will take the user to the Portfolio page, where I display many of my coding portfolios.
The "Contact" link in the Navbar will take the user to the Contact page.
The page that is currently displayed will show the respective navbar link as active (darker font than the other link).

The user can contact me through email and LinkeIn.
```

## Future Development plans
```
User of this website will be able to contact me and send message through the "Contact" page.
Clicking on each of the portfolio image will take the user to the respective website on a separate window
```

## Techniques/Framework used in this portfolio

```
* Hero image
* Header, Main & Footer - semantic tags
* Used Bootstrap, to develope the portfolio site with the following items:
   * A navbar
   * A responsive layout
   * Responsive images
* Matched the design of the webpage to match the reference images/screenshots that were provided in the instructions
* Used Bootstrap grid system (container, row & column)
* As the screen/media sizes increase and decrease, the navbar, content and image will adjust to fit into the window size
* The layout (navbar, header, footer) should be consistent across all the webpages.
* Used "form" for Contact page
* Sticky Footer
