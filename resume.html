                                            <li>• As a business analyst, I worked with business liason group to enhance
                                                and support many inventory management systems.

                                            <li>• I was a go-to person for critical system called Market Fare Table,
                                                which
                                                was a critical piece with
                                                Seat Availability Calculation. It was a feed that was consumed by
                                                various external vendors like Google, Amadeus etc.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>• It was a highly time sensitive application which required immediate
                                                attention and very detail analysis when issued occurred.</li>

                                            <li>• As a BA, worked with product owners to understand the needs of
                                                products
                                                and took it from idea to fruition. QSI GUI (Quality Service Index) was
                                                one such application.</li>
                                            <li>• Played Lead BA roles in very high visibility projects that span across
                                                multiple channels. 777Mod was one such multi-phase project, where all
